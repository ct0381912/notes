- "Today's programming wisdom is to embrace the SOLID principles: Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion. These guidelines promote code that's maintainable, scalable, and adaptable to change, which are key virtues in the ever-evolving world of software development." 

In detail:
1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one primary responsibility or job.
2. **Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**: Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification, allowing you to add new functionality without changing existing code.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes, ensuring that behavior defined in a parent class applies to its children without unexpected side effects.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use; instead, interfaces should be broken down into smaller, more specific ones.
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. This way, changes in lower-level modules won't affect higher-level ones, increasing flexibility and maintainability.
